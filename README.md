## Look Out the Window (Beginner Project)

This is a small frontend project. You can search short videos by city and time of day and watch them on the page.

### Whatâ€™s inside
- `index.html` â€” the page markup
- `styles/` â€” CSS files (main styles, preloader, errors)
- `scripts/` â€” JavaScript logic (fetch data, show cards, switch videos)
- `fonts/` â€” web fonts used on the page

### Notes
- The design is made to be pixelâ€‘perfect at 1200px width and bigger.
- If something doesnâ€™t load, check your internet and look at the browser DevTools â†’ Network tab.

Good luck and have fun learning! ðŸŽ¯
