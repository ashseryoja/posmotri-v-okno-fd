## Look Out the Window (Beginner Project)

This is a small frontend project. You can search short videos by city and time of day and watch them on the page.

### Repository
https://github.com/ashseryoja/posmotri-v-okno-fd

### What’s inside
- `index.html` — the page markup
- `styles/` — CSS files (main styles, preloader, errors)
- `scripts/` — JavaScript logic (fetch data, show cards, switch videos)
- `fonts/` — web fonts used on the page

### Notes
- The design is made to be pixel‑perfect at 1200px width and bigger.
